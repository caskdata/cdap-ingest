================
How-to Run Tests
================

Tests are located in ``test`` directory of the source tree root.


Unittest
========

In command shell, enter::

  $ python runtests.py


Integration tests
=================

::

  self.config_file = 'config_name.json'


In command shell, enter::

  $ python stream_integration_test.py
  $ python stream_integration_test_ssl.py

To configure tests, alter these files:

  ``cdap_config.json``             - for integration with CDAP Local Sandbox
  ``cdap_ssl_config.json``         - for integration with SSL and Auth-enabled CDAP


Adding New Tests
================
New tests should be derived from the ``StreamTestBase`` and ``unittest.TestCase`` classes.
The child object should initialize the ``self.config_file`` variable in the ``setUp`` method
and call ``base_set_up`` of ``StreamTestBase`` to initialize tests.

Example::

  class TestStreamClient(unittest.TestCase, StreamTestBase):

      def setUp(self):
          self.config_file = 'cdap_config.json'
          self.base_set_up()
