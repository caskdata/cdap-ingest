=====================================================================
Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP) File DropZone Integration Tests
=====================================================================

This project contains integration tests for the CDAP File DropZone.

*Note*: The File DropZone is no longer supported as of CDAP 3.0. Most likely, it will still
work, but because File DropZone is not aware of CDAP Namespaces, it would only work with
the default namespace.
